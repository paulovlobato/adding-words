My proposed solution to Open Kattis Adding Worlds problem

The problem link: https://open.kattis.com/problems/addingwords

The problem should run with:

```$ javac core/ProblemA.java```

and then

```$ java core.problemA < sample.in > sample.out```

to input the sample.in file and output the STDIO operations to a new sample.out file.

If needed, there is a scanner option that loads the sample.in file, so you can run it when using any IDE of choice
instead of Alt + Tabing for the nearest terminal just to manually compile and run the Java File.
